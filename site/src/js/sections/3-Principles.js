            We found ourselves doing the same thing over and over again and
            realized we needed to to a better job of sharing our frontend code.

          <h4 className=" fw-bold">Consistency is Key</h4>
          <p className="measure">
            A lot of our designs had inconsistancies â€“ spacing, type scale and
            divergant code were all culprits. Indigo's CSS removes choices so we
            can get more done.

            Other frameworks present many choices to designers and developers.
            Since this is intended just for us, we could remove a lot of
            decision fatigue from our creative proccess.

            Building the whole stack has it's advantages, but we have a lot to
            do, so we want to design things once and move on.
